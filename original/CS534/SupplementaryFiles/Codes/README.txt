This folder contains all the relevant scripts and functions used, including any supporting functions. They have been placed into the relevant folders with descriptive names, as follows:

1- Cox_Regression: scripts used fo the cox regression experiments.

2- KNN:
	2a: early_attempts - scripts and functions used early during model optimization, including using K-M estimators before the non-cumulative implementation was adopted, as well as early gradent-descent experiments.
	2b: Experiments - scripts used in various experiments used throughout the text (eg feature correlation experiments).
	2c: Feature_selection_RightWay - Filter and Wrapper feature selection and model accuracy assessment.
	2d: Keyfunctions - Most important functions and scripts. To apply the finalized KNN without feature selection, use BasicModel_KNN4.m script.
	2e: Model_Interpretation - Scripts used in model interpretation experiments.

3- NeuralNetwork: All functions and scripts used in the neural network. There is an instructions.txt file that explains all the details for implementing this method.

4- Preprocessing: scripts used in pre-processing.

5- Supporting_functions: all supporting functions needed to run the codes (no other dependencies).
